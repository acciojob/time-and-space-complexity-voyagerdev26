	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity: How an algorithm's execution time increases with input size (N).
How it's measured: By counting basic operations (comparisons, assignments).
	Hence it helps in determing efficient algorithm at a situation</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>: How an algorithm's memory usage scales with input size (N).
How it's measured: Total memory (input + auxiliary space for variables, recursion, etc.).
	It can be O(n) when we need to maybe store each data till n as we need to process on it ,or through recursion
	it fills stack space maximum till n calls and at nth call recursion starts solving so there also stack space maximum occupied is
	of n levels</p>
